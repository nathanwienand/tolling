## System Overview

- **OBU Service:** Connects via WebSocket and transmits location data.
- **Receiver Service:** Receives data and forwards it to Kafka.
- **Calculator Service:** Processes location data from Kafka, calculates distances.
- **Aggregator Service:** Receives calculated distances and determines charges.

## Installation and Running

1. **Go 1.21+**: Ensure Go 1.21 or later is installed. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

2. **Kafka**: Requires a Kafka broker instance. [Download Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)

3. **Make**: Unix-like systems have it pre-installed. For Windows, use [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

4. **Protocol Buffers**: Install Protocol Buffers for gRPC. [Protobuf Installation](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

5. **Running Services**: Use the Makefile to build and run services:

   ```bash
   # Build and run individual services
   $ make obu
   $ make receiver
   $ make calculator
   $ make aggregator
   ```

## Features

- üî± Clean architecture
- ‚öôÔ∏è Makefile 
- üóÉÔ∏è Kafka
- üîÑ gRPC/HTTP
- üö¶ Graceful shutdown in some repos
